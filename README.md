# Double_Split_With_Observer
Double Slit Experiment with Observer â€“ Qiskit Simulation This project simulates the quantum double-slit experiment with an observer/detector. Adding observation collapses the wavefunction, removing superposition and destroying the interference pattern, illustrating the shift from wave-like to particle-like behavior.
